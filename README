Refresh Safari

This script is super simple, with an extremely focused purpose:

While web developing, especially when making minor CSS changes, you often have to save the file in your text editor, then press apple-tab to change focus to your browser, then hit apple-r to refresh to see the changes.

Worse, sometimes you need to hit apple-tab a few times because you've used another application since the last time you refreshed the browser. This usually results in me pressing apple-r when in another app, yielding undesireable consequences.

This script simply refreshes the current tab in Safari.

If you use Launchbar or Quicksilver, or even Apple's spotlight, just throw this script somewhere indexable, then run it.

You can run it while focus is on any other program (and Launchbar, Quicksilver, and Spotlight all can be called from anywhere, any time).

You'll need to open it first with AppleScript editor and compile it.

Enjoy!
